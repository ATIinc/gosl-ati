# Gosl. fun. Special functions, DFT, FFT, Bessel, elliptical integrals, orthogonal polynomials, interpolators

This package implements _special_ functions such as orthogonal polynomials and elliptical functions
of first, second and third kind.

Routines to interpolate and/or assist on spectral methods are also available; e.g. FourierInterp,
ChebyInterp.
