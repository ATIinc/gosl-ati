# Gosl. pde. Partial Differential Equations

Package `pde` implements structures and algorithms for solving partial differential equations.

## TODO

1. Explain how to use the FDM (Finite Difference Method) solver
2. Explain how to use the SPC (Spectral Collocation) solver
3. Implement the FEM (Finite Element Method) solver
4. Add more tests
